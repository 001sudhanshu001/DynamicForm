# Dynamic Form(Backend)

## Introduction
In various applications where dynamic and adaptable forms are required, this project offers a flexible solution. 
For example, consider a multi-tenant platform where different organizations need to collect different types of
information from their usersâ€”such as surveys, registrations, or feedback forms. Instead of having a rigid form
structure, this project allows each organization to design and implement forms tailored to their unique requirements. 
This means that organizations can adjust fields, types, and validations as needed without modifying the core system, 
ensuring that the solution remains relevant and adaptable across different use cases.

## Understand Project with a Scenario: <br>

This project is designed for multi-tenant environments. To illustrate its functionality, consider a School 
Management Application shared among multiple schools, each with unique form requirements.

### User Roles

In this scenario, the key roles are:

- **SUPER_ADMIN**: Manages the overall system, including user access and global settings.
- **ADMIN**: School-specific administrators who create and customize forms based on their school's needs.
- **STUDENT/PARENT**: Users who fill out the forms created by the ADMIN, such as admission forms or feedback surveys.

This setup allows for flexible form management tailored to the specific needs of each school while maintaining a consistent system framework.

## Steps To Create Dynamic Form

First of all Signup to get the Access(Bearer) & Refresh token. The Signup Request is as follows :
```json
    {
      "firstName": "Sudhanshu",
      "lastName": "Arya",
      "email": "sudhanshu@gmail.com",
      "password": "#4Ypu*78H026"
    }
```

1. To create a new form, it required a name and a remarks (reason for creating form).
   **Request URI: /dynamic-form/create-form**
    ```json
    {
        "name": "Form Name",
        "remarks": "Small Description about the Form"
    }
    ```
   _name_ and _remark_ are required fields.
   Initially, the form will be created with *IN_ACTIVE* status.
   **form name is unique** across all forms, no duplicate name allowed.


2. To add fields to the form, it required a form id, field name, field type, and field validation rules.
   **Request URI: /dynamic-form/add-form-field**

   Sample Request For TEXT type Form Field:
   ```json
    {
        "formId": 1,
        "name": "Field Name",
        "type": "TEXT",
        "label": "Field Label",
        "validationRules": {
            "REQUIRED": true,
            "MIN_LENGTH": 5,
            "MAX_LENGTH": 10,
            "PATTERN": "^[a-zA-Z0-9]*$"
        },
        "remarks": "Reason for adding field",
        "placeHolder": "Field Placeholder",
        "helpDescription": "Field Help Description"
    }
    ```

   Available validation rules are:
   ```
        REQUIRED -> for all fields
        MIN_LENGTH, MAX_LENGTH, PATTERN -> for text fields
        MIN_VALUE, MAX_VALUE -> for number fields
        ALLOWED_FILE_TYPES, MIN_FILES, MAX_FILES -> for file fields
        MIN_DATE, MAX_DATE -> for date fields
        MIN_TIME, MAX_TIME -> for time fields
        MIN_DATE_TIME, MAX_DATE_TIME -> for datetime fields
   ```
3. After creation of form field, it is required to activate the form field.

   **Request URI: /dynamic-form/make-form-field-active/{formId}/{formFieldId}**<br>
   formId and formFieldId are path variables.

4. After activating at least one form field, the form can be activated.

   **Request URI: /dynamic-form/make-form-active/{formId}**<br>
   formId is path variable.

5. When the form is active, it will be available for filling it.

   **Request URI: /dynamic-form/fetch-form-to-fill/{formId}**<br>
   formId is path variable.<br>
   Where neither form is active not it's form field active, it will return 404.<br>
   When formFields are active, but form is not active, it will return 400.<br>
   Sample Response For Form Is:
    ```json
   {
      "response": {
          "formId": 1,
          "name": "Form Name",
          "remarks": "Reason for creating form",
          "formStatus": "ACTIVE",
          "htmlFormFields": [
              {
                  "id": 1,
                  "name": "Field Name",
                  "type": "TEXT",
                  "label": "Field Label",
                  "placeHolder": "Field Placeholder",
                  "helpDescription": "Field Help Description",
                  "sortingOrder": 1,
                  "formFieldStatus": "ACTIVE",
                  "remarks": "Reason for adding field",
                  "createdDate": "2021-08-01T00:00:00",
                  "lastModifiedDate": "2021-08-01T00:00:00",
                  "version": 1,
                  "displayOptions": {},
                  "validationRules": {
                      "REQUIRED": true,
                      "MIN_LENGTH": 5,
                      "MAX_LENGTH": 10,
                      "PATTERN": "^[a-zA-Z0-9]*$"
                  }
              }
          ]
      }
   }
    ```

6. To submit form, it required form id and form fields with values.

   **Request URI: /dynamic-form/submit-form**<br>
   Sample Request For Submitting Form:
    ```json
    {
        "formId": 7,
        "userId": 4,
        "fieldValues": {
            "student_name": "Sudhanshu",
            "gender": "male",
            "interests": ["a", "b", "c"],
            "dob": "2003-05-16",
            "..."
        }
    }
    ```
   formId, userId and fieldValues are required fields.<br>
